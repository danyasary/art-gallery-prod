            About Us
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm mb-4 lg:mb-8">
            Inspired by a nomadic tribe that calls themselves the Amazigh (which
            means free or noble people) in North Africa, Artmazigh team believes
            that everyone is a free and unique individual, as well as the
            imagination. Through the illustration works that we have done since
            2011 and together with people who believe in the power of
            imagination (Musicians, Politicians, Soldiers, Writers, Youtubers,
            Gamers, Athletes and many more), we call on everyone to have brave
            imaginations and go beyond the feeling of failing to make it happen.
            1,334 people have teamed up with us to make their imaginations come
            true. Itâ€™s your turn now! Visit us on: @art.mazigh (Instagram) and
